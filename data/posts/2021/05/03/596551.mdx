This is the first post in Learn C# With UTF seriese inspired by [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/hello-world).

Testing is the one of most important technique in software development.
But most tutorials do not adopt test from the beginning.
After learning basic concepts and syntax they introduce the test.
Make motter worse, just ignore as if there are no.

In the original tutorial seriese, the learning starts with the testing from the very beginning.
I also follow this way because I want to get used to the test.

## Hello, World

Let's start with a widely used example, Hello World.
//TODO: Write the complete hello world test case

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class HelloWorld : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("Hello, World");
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
```
